### Problem

Jobs

### Solution

Open market

Level playing field

Stick to the script

### How does it make money

Be the best worker on a level playing field

No boss, no owner

### How do I get paid

For big projects, open a joint checking account with clients at any online bank. Then open one of your own. Deposit payment to joint account, then transfer to your own account.

For small projects, start with a small budget.

For disagreements, chat with the community. Someone will help you. Everyone works together.

SOON: Automatic crypto payout on test pass/fail.

### Business objectives

Start with easy work, software implementation mostly.

End with advancing collective human knowledge.

### Features

Lives on your phone.

If it's good, it goes live.

Reverse projects with focus on division of labor.

### Lifebar

Project health

Hit when something on the project goes wrong

Usually hits happen happens when you haven't done it before

Heals when work processes are proven to be fixed and code is shipped

Grows with completed projects, reference code, open source contributions, and wins against competing process systems

At zero loose a life

Earn a life with risk management and incident response strategies

Loosing all lives remove process from site

Game over: "Restart the game" cameo with saved checkpoints, bringing process back to site.

Design Guidance: Environment changes project

### Moneybar

Stamina for power-ups

Hit when buying something for the project

With enough money, any can build anything, so we need a limit

Heals when funding is made available

Grows with completed projects, customers and earnings, and wins against competing process systems

At zero, nothing really happens, just can't buy anything until funded.

Can still work for free.

Design Guidance: Project changes environment

### User Level

Increases with greater market use of features built with process

Decreases with less market use of features built with process

No outage for users on process removal

Features eventually will need support

Users will go somewhere.

### Programmer Level

Increases with greater programmer use of process

Decreases with less programmer use of process

Outage for programmers on process removal

### Gameplay

Hits occur from rules with brain.js
Hits source from github issues
Oversights, for instance, did not know storybook needs extra config for static files + typescript. Usually from not doing it before
Programmers screen gets hit if we don't make \$25 a day
Propsector screen appears, and can go away:

- Clientele
- Funding
- Setup
- Team

Work comes in form of playing cards. 2 to 10, AKQJ, 4 suits.

New button asks for URL. Click on stage, and things start happening. Fork github, provision figma, add storybook and diez provisioning.

! Problems

### Closing Thoughts

- I don't want to work.
- I want to see what I want built.
- If someone else does the hard work, I don't care.
- I don't want to read either. Please use graphics.

### Developer Hurt Log

https://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=23223604
Logged hurt events during development:

- Diez extract from Figma for SVG. Heal by exporting SVG from figma.

- Github Package Registry. Need setup to publish design guide.

- Design tokens not extracted by diez, for instance borders

- Diez compile to webpack build. Need to add to webpack externals to build.

- Storybook does not detect compiled diez module from Github package registry

- Event emitter instead of context or lifting up state to prevent rerenders

- Sass for storybook, needed preset

- diez integration into webpack for sass

- GPR support for Netlify

- Webpack html plugin instead of html template from Typescript, netlify build directory

- Diez remove lottie

- Typescript demo, need dev server

- Copy static files

- Diez source map errors, need exclude in config

- Need vs code debug

- Need tests, needed sourcemaps in webpack config

- Launch storybook and test and dev server on start dev

### Coming Soon

- Automatic crypto payout on test pass/fail.
- Geo database of offline dat addresses for download in app. Communicate with background sync device to device.
