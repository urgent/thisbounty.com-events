## Problem

Jobs

## Solution

Open market, level playing field, stick to the script

## Principles

### 1. Track goals, like reduced costs. Money matters. Code and operations don't

All roads lead to finance. New clients attract finance. Taps on a keyboard tune them out.

### 2. Focus on core business

- Fix programmer freelancing bugs of access, fees, collaboration and knowledge.
- Instead of one project, one programmer, programmers collaborate.
- New projects have no entry. Work has proven defined stages.
- Scale out projects from websites and apps to research as needed for jobs.

### 3. Build clear rules outside the tech

#### To hire a programmer

1. Click on a Bounty. A Bounty is a proven software production method.
2. Click on the New Button to create a Lead. A Lead is a work order.

#### To work

1. Click on a Lead. A Lead Card bookmarks.
2. Click on the Lead Card. A Lead Action occurs.
3. A Lead Action opens an offsite platform like figma or github issues, in-app features like project storm, or launches a local IDE.

### 4. List everything not core business. At least you are aware

- Project management gamification
- Graphic design
- [React component communication](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61582960/11971788)
- Design framework and component library integration
- Build
- Dev server and debugging
- Webpack HTML template
- Arcade demo mode
- localForage for app persistence
- Websocket for communication between users
- Websocket message validation with io-ts
- Bot for admin
- Bot for reporting

### 5. Fix bugs. Add features. Limit hot fixes

Better to start with a bug fix than an overarching vision which often meanders.

Start with existing platforms. Use their features, and more important community users. Likely you are not the first one who had the idea.

Start with your own community who have less stake in losses.

Think of replacing a packaged app, such as WhatsApp replacing the phone button and Instagram replacing the camera.

In mechanics, designs simplify by tightening bolts. Any stress less than within the bolts goes away.
Use your own apps. Be the major stress of your own apps. Consume all the content. Then all other users have a ways to go before they catch up.

Augment and accent is easier than aggregate or disrupt.

### 6. Use IDEs and version control instead of inner platforms

Users are more resourceful than you think. Customers hire experts for a reason.

### 7. If simple features like sort do not work, remove the complex code, go back to the tutorial

If plans fail, get over it and move on.

### 8. Either don't do it, or do it full effort

Learn to say no.

Launch quick. Get to live customers fast even if it's just a newsletter signup.

### 9. Encourage others. Favor the launch, not who launches

Sometimes abandoning a known idea is the fastest way to see it built.

If it doesn't get built, there's a reason. Sometimes the world is not a nice place. Best not to provoke.

## How does it make money

Be the best worker on a level playing field

No boss, no owner

## How do I get paid

For big leads, open a joint checking account with clients at any online bank. Then open one of your own. Deposit payment to joint account, then transfer to your own account.

For small leads, start with a small budget. I can start work for free really sells.

For disagreements, chat with the community. Someone will help you. Everyone works together.

SOON: Automatic crypto payout on test pass/fail.
